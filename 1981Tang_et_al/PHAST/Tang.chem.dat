# Following the initial call to PHREEQC, selected output for initial and transient conditions are written 
#  to prefix.chem.xyz.tsv.
# Frequently, the SELECTED_OUTPUT data block is located at the end of the 'prefix.chem.dat' file,
#  following an END keyword, which results in no data being written to the selected_output file.
